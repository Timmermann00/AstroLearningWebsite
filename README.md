## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Footer.astro
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Header.astro
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Hamburger.astro
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Navigation.astro
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Social.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ BaseLayout.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ about.astro
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ blog.astro
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ styles/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ global.css
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/` and `src/layouts/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro components and layouts.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
